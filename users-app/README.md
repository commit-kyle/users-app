## General info
This is a simple User creation app.

When opening the [project](https://commit-kyle.github.io/users-app/), you are welcomed by a form with two inputs. One to simply enter your name and another for your age. 
This miniature form has been configured to implement the useRef Hook for its data retrieval, shying away from state management, specifically for input elements.
Additionally, it has been coded with basic form validation logic for unexpected input entries, along with meaningful error messages which get displayed through a modal. The error modal and backdrop have been designed as such to implement the use of a Portal. This feature, made available by ReactDOM, provides a much cleaner and more semantic element structure to this project (although tiny).

## Technologies
Users App is created using:
* react version: 17.0.2
